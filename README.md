My startup was having trouble with the other task management software in the market such as Asana, Notion, Slack. The team was unable to keep track of the tasks assigned to them and there was no proper record of what was due and what has already been done.

Hence, I took it upon myself to solve this issue and decided to build a custom spreadsheet which will allow my team to keep track of tasks. This has significantly improved our efficiency in completing tasks and tracking progress.

One of the key features of this dashboard is color coding, which helps us easily identify completed tasks, those in progress, and overdue tasks. Additionally, the Time remaining column acts as a gentle reminder to keep me on track and motivated.
